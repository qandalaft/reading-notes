**1. Headings and paragraphs**
* Headings 

this tags we can use to make the heading for the main heading we usw this tag `<h1> </h1>`
and insid of it we can put the Text (the main one in this case)

** levels of headings**

> we have 6 levels of headings from `<h1>` to `<h6>`

`<h1>` is used for main headings

`<h2>` is used for subheadings

If there are further sections 

under the subheadings then the 
`<h3>` element is used, and so 
on...

>Browsers display the contents of 
headings at different sizes. The 
contents of an <h1> element is 
the largest, and the contents of 
an <h6> element is the smallest. 
The exact size at which each 
browser shows the headings 
can vary slightly. Users can also 
adjust the size of text in their 
browser. You will see how to 
control the size of text, its color, 
and the fonts used when we 
come to look at CSS.

* paragraphs

this tag we use to ceart a paragraph `<p></p>`
>By default, a browser will show 
each paragraph on a new line 
with some space between it and 
any subsequent paragraphs.

**2. Bold, italic, emphasis**
* Bold & italic
1. Bold 

this tag we use to make the font Bold `<b> </b>`
>The `<b>` element also represents 
a section of text that would be 
presented in a visually different 
way (for example key words in a 
paragraph) although the use of 
the` <b>` element does not imply 
any additional meaning.

2.italic

 this tag we use to make the font italic `<i> </i>`
 >The <i> element also represents 
a section of text that would be 
said in a different way from 
surrounding content â€” such as 
technical terms, names of ships, 
foreign words, thoughts, or other 
terms that would usually be 
italicized.

3.emphasis

we have tags inside the `HTML` to make some Text important  this tags is `<strong> </strong>` and `<im> </im>`
the `<strong>` tag make the Text inside it Bold but 
the browser know this Text is important and it show it first we the user search for it and the same with the `<im>` it make the Text inside important but in italic style 

**3.Superscript & superscript**
* Superscript

the `<sup> </sup>` tag is used 
to contain characters that 
should be superscript such 
as the suffixes of dates or 
mathematical concepts like 
raising a number to a power.

* superscript 

the `<sub> </sub>` tag  is used to 
contain characters that should 
be subscript. It is commonly 
used with foot notes or chemical 
formulas
