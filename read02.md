# what is git 
-Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.
### why using git 
-
Git is all about efficiency. For developers, it eliminates everything from the time wasted passing commits over a network connection to the man hours required to integrate changes in a centralized version control system. It even makes better use of junior developers by giving them a safe environment to work in
### how to using git with github on replit
* recently, Replit has added integrations for Git and GitHub. now, you can interact with Git and GitHub within the same interface you are already used to. sounds cool, huh?

this guide is for people that are new to Git and / or want to learn more about Replit's Git and GitHub integrations. don't worry if you do not know much about Git or if you have not used it before. i will try to explain the topics with as few technical terms as possible

#### there are six main sections to this tutorial. if you are new to Git, i would recommend only focussing on sections 1, 2, and 3
1. Use Git with Replit
- a. Create a Git repository while using Replit
- b. Making commits to the Git repository
- c. Slightly more detailed explanation of Git (for git-newbies (ðŸ‘‹ haii welcome ðŸ˜ƒ))
2. Use Git with Replit (and 'sync' that with GitHub)
3. Import and use an existing Git repository from GitHub
4. Use Git with Replit multiplayer sessions
5. Use Git with Replit multiplayer sessions (and 'sync' that with GitHub)
6. Exploring Git
7. Troubleshooting
# 1.  Use Git with Replit
-a. Create a Git repository while using Replit
first, you need to create any type of repl. i will be choosing an 'html, css, js' repl. feel free to follow along, especially if you are new to Git ðŸ˜œ



- after you created your repl, there is a icon in the left sidebar you can click on. that pops open the Git repository viewer. in there, click 'Create a git repository'
### but what is a Git repository?
- for example, we created a Git repository for the my-website project. it stores a history of our code. you, the developer, choose how detailed this history is. right now, the history is not detailed; there is only one commit called ('Initial commit')
