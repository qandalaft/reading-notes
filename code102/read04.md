## Introduction 
- In this page I will talk about JavaScript and some information about this just-in-time compiled programming language
## what is JavaScript.
- JavaScript is scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.) and its compatible with [HTML](https://qandalaft.github.io/reading-notes/read03) and CSS ( we will talk about CSS later on ) 
### so what can I do with JavaScript
- Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name in a variable called name.
- Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example we take the string "Player 1: " and join it to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g. ''Player 1: Chris".
- Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a click event in our example above to detect when the button is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label.

### now How we use JavaScript
- we can use JavaScript with the [HTML](https://qandalaft.github.io/reading-notes/read03) 
in 2 ways 
1. inline method 
- Inline JavaScript can be achieved by using Script tag inside the body of the HTML, and write all the JavaScript code inside the Script tag.
and the Syntax is :
< script>
    // Java ScreptCode
</ script>
2. creating JS. file 
- this way can be achieved by using Script tag inside the body of the HTML and add (src=”file name.js”) to link the JS file with the HTML page 
and write the code inside the file itself and this is the best practices to use JavaScript with the HTML
#### now how we wirte the code inside JavaScript
- The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:
1. Fixed values
2. Variable values
- Fixed values are called Literals.
- Variable values are called Variables.
#### JavaScript Literals
- The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:
1. Numbers are written with or without decimals like 
: 10,90,2 or 

2.5,3.6 etc..........

2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes like:

"John Doe"
'John Doe'
#### JavaScript Variables
- In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.

JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.

An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6:
let x;
x = 6; or

var y = 50 now in JavaScript programming languag we can put the ; or without
