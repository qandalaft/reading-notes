# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

>New research reveals surprising truths about why some work groups thrive and others falter.

like most 25-year-olds, Julia Rozovsky wasn’t sure what she wanted to do with her life. She had worked at a consulting firm, but it wasn’t a good match. Then she became a researcher for two professors at Harvard, which was interesting but lonely. Maybe a big corporation would be a better fit. Or perhaps a fast-growing start-up. All she knew for certain was that she wanted to find a job that was more social. ‘‘I wanted to be part of a community, part of something people were building together,’’ she told me. She thought about various opportunities — Internet companies, a Ph.D. program — but nothing seemed exactly right. So in 2009, she chose the path that allowed her to put off making a decision: She applied to business schools and was accepted by the Yale School of Management.

When Rozovsky arrived on campus, she was assigned to a study group carefully engineered by the school to foster tight bonds. Study groups have become a rite of passage at M.B.A. programs, a way for students to practice working in teams and a reflection of the increasing demand for employees who can adroitly navigate group dynamics. A worker today might start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers, then send emails to colleagues marketing a new brand, then jump on a conference call planning an entirely different product line, while also juggling team meetings with accounting and the party-planning committee. To prepare students for that complex world, business schools around the country have revised their curriculums to emphasize team-focused learning.

Every day, between classes or after dinner, Rozovsky and her four teammates gathered to discuss homework assignments, compare spreadsheets and strategize for exams. Everyone was smart and curious, and they had a lot in common: They had gone to similar colleges and had worked at analogous firms. These shared experiences, Rozovsky hoped, would make it easy for them to work well together. But it didn’t turn out that way. ‘‘There are lots of people who say some of their best business-school friends come from their study groups,’’ Rozovsky told me. ‘‘It wasn’t like that for me.’’

Instead, Rozovsky’s study group was a source of stress. ‘‘I always felt like I had to prove myself,’’ she said. The team’s dynamics could put her on edge. When the group met, teammates sometimes jockeyed for the leadership position or criticized one another’s ideas. There were conflicts over who was in charge and who got to represent the group in class. ‘‘People would try to show authority by speaking louder or talking over each other,’’ Rozovsky told me. ‘‘I always felt like I had to be careful not to make mistakes around them.’’

So Rozovsky started looking for other groups she could join. A classmate mentioned that some students were putting together teams for ‘‘case competitions,’’ contests in which participants proposed solutions to real-world business problems that were evaluated by judges, who awarded trophies and cash. The competitions were voluntary, but the work wasn’t all that different from what Rozovsky did with her study group: conducting lots of research and financial analyses, writing reports and giving presentations. The members of her case-competition team had a variety of professional experiences: Army officer, researcher at a think tank, director of a health-education nonprofit organization and consultant to a refugee program. Despite their disparate backgrounds, however, everyone clicked. They emailed one another dumb jokes and usually spent the first 10 minutes of each meeting chatting. When it came time to brainstorm, ‘‘we had lots of crazy ideas,’’ Rozovsky said.

One of her favorite competitions asked teams to come up with a new business to replace a student-run snack store on Yale’s campus. Rozovsky proposed a nap room and selling earplugs and eyeshades to make money. Someone else suggested filling the space with old video games. There were ideas about clothing swaps. Most of the proposals were impractical, but ‘‘we all felt like we could say anything to each other,’’ Rozovsky told me. ‘‘No one worried that the rest of the team was judging them.’’ Eventually, the team settled on a plan for a micro­gym with a handful of exercise classes and a few weight machines. They won the competition. (The micro­gym — with two stationary bicycles and three treadmills — still exists.)

Rozovsky’s study group dissolved in her second semester (it was up to the students whether they wanted to continue). Her case team, however, stuck together for the two years she was at Yale.

It always struck Rozovsky as odd that her experiences with the two groups were dissimilar. Each was composed of people who were bright and outgoing. When she talked one on one with members of her study group, the exchanges were friendly and warm. It was only when they gathered as a team that things became fraught. By contrast, her case-competition team was always fun and easygoing. In some ways, the team’s members got along better as a group than as individual friends.

‘‘I couldn’t figure out why things had turned out so different,’’ Rozovsky told me. ‘‘It didn’t seem like it had to happen that way.’’

#  Transforms

* With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.

* The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

* Within this lesson we’ll take a look at both two-dimensional and three-dimensional transforms. Generally speaking, browser support for the transform property isn’t great, but it is getting better every day. For the best support vendor prefixes are encouraged, however you may need to download the nightly version of Chrome to see all of these transforms in action.

## Transform Syntax

The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

```html
div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
}
```
>Notice how the transform property includes multiple vendor prefixes to gain the best support across all browsers. The un-prefixed declaration comes last to overwrite the prefixed versions, should a browser fully support the transform property
In the interest of brevity, the remainder of this lesson will not include vendor prefixes. They are, however, strongly encouraged for any code in a production environment. Over time we will be able to remove these prefixes, however keeping them in is the safest approach for the time being.

## 2D Transforms

* Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. We’ll start by discussing how to transform elements on a two-dimensional plane, and then work our way into three-dimensional transforms.

**2D Rotate**
>The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise. The default point of rotation is the center of the element, 50% 50%, both horizontally and vertically. Later we will discuss how you can change this default point of rotation.

```html
<figure class="box-1">Box 1</figure>
<figure class="box-2">Box 2</figure>
```
```css
.box-1 {
  transform: rotate(20deg);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: rotate(-55deg);
}
```
## 2D Scale

* Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element. The default scale value is 1, therefore any value between .99 and .01 makes an element appear smaller while any value greater than or equal to 1.01 makes an element appear larger.

```html
<figure class="box-1">Box 1</figure>
<figure class="box-2">Box 2</figure>
```
```css
.box-1 {
  transform: scale(.75);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: scale(1.25);
}
```

# Transitions & Animations

One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations. Front end developers have been asking for the ability to design these interactions within HTML and CSS, without the use of JavaScript or Flash, for years. Now their wish has come true.

With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

## Transitions

As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Not all of these are required to build a transition, with the first three are the most popular.

In the example below the box will change its background color over the course of 1 second in a linear fashion.

```css
.box {
  background: #2db34a;
  transition-property: background;
  transition-duration: 1s;
  transition-timing-function: linear;
}
.box:hover {
  background: #ff7b29;
}
```
**Transitional Property**

As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Not all of these are required to build a transition, with the first three are the most popular.

In the example below the box will change its background color over the course of 1 second in a linear fashion.

```css
.box {
  background: #2db34a;
  transition-property: background;
  transition-duration: 1s;
  transition-timing-function: linear;
}
.box:hover {
  background: #ff7b29;
}
```
**Transition Duration**

The duration in which a transition takes place is set using the transition-duration property. The value of this property can be set using general timing values, including seconds (s) and milliseconds (ms). These timing values may also come in fractional measurements, .2s for example.

When transitioning multiple properties you can set multiple durations, one for each property. As with the transition-property property value, multiple durations can be declared using comma separated values. The order of these values when identifying individual properties and durations does matter. For example, the first property identified within the transition-property property will match up with the first time identified within the transition-duration property, and so forth.

If multiple properties are being transitioned with only one duration value declared, that one value will be the duration of all the transitioned properties.

```css
.box {
  background: #2db34a;
  border-radius: 6px;
  transition-property: background, border-radius;
  transition-duration: .2s, 1s;
  transition-timing-function: linear;
}
.box:hover {
  background: #ff7b29;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

*Transition Timing*

The transition-timing-function property is used to set the speed in which a transition will move. Knowing the duration from the transition-duration property a transition can have multiple speeds within a single duration. A few of the more popular keyword values for the transition-timing-function property include linear, ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out.

The linear keyword value identifies a transition moving in a constant speed from one state to another. The ease-in value identifies a transition that starts slowly and speeds up throughout the transition, while the ease-out value identifies a transition that starts quickly and slows down throughout the transition. The ease-in-out value identifies a transition that starts slowly, speeds up in the middle, then slows down again before ending.

Each timing function has a cubic-bezier curve behind it, which can be specifically set using the cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2) value. Additional values include step-start, step-stop, and a uniquely identified steps(number_of_steps, direction) value.

When transitioning multiple properties, you can identify multiple timing functions. These timing function values, as with other transition property values, may be declared as comma separated values.

```css
.box {
  background: #2db34a;
  border-radius: 6px;
  transition-property: background, border-radius;
  transition-duration: .2s, 1s;
  transition-timing-function: linear, ease-in;
}
.box:hover {
  background: #ff7b29;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```
*Transition Delay*
On top of declaring the transition property, duration, and timing function, you can also set a delay with the transition-delay property. The delay sets a time value, seconds or milliseconds, that determines how long a transition should be stalled before executing. As with all other transition properties, to delay numerous transitions, each delay can be declared as comma separated values.

```css
.box {
  background: #2db34a;
  border-radius: 6px
  transition-property: background, border-radius;
  transition-duration: .2s, 1s;
  transition-timing-function: linear, ease-in;
  transition-delay: 0s, 1s;
}
.box:hover {
  background: #ff7b29;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

**Shorthand Transitions** 

Declaring every transition property individually can become quite intensive, especially with vendor prefixes. Fortunately there is a shorthand property, transition, capable of supporting all of these different properties and values. Using the transition value alone, you can set every transition value in the order of transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and lastly transition-delay. Do not use commas with these values unless you are identifying numerous transitions.

To set numerous transitions at once, set each individual group of transition values, then use a comma to separate each additional group of transition values.

```css
.box {
  background: #2db34a;
  border-radius: 6px;
  transition: background .2s linear, border-radius 1s ease-in 1s;
}
.box:hover {
  color: #ff7b29;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```
