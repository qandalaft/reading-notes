> (iteracy) Most tablets are able to display non-responsive web pages without any problems, but mobiles have several challenges:

- Screen shape - most smartphone users hold their phones vertically, in portrait mode. This means the screen is taller than it is wide, the opposite of a desktop computer or laptop.
- Screen size - smartphones have very small screens compared to desktop computers, so designers need to make the pages simpler. Different models have different screen sizes, but as a rule of thumb aim for 340px as a maximum width for your mobile portrait design.
- User interactions - mobile phones don't have a mouse, so effects that appear "on hover" or "on blur" don't work.
- Navigation - the majority of websites tend to have a full-width top navigation bar which doesn't work at all on a smartphone in portrait mode.
- Lower bandwidth - it depends whether you're in the middle of a city or the countryside, but mobile users on a cellular connection (connecting to the internet using "data") can have slower internet speeds. You may want to replace the full-screen background video on the mobile version of your site.
