# Lists

* in this part we will going to talk about the lists the numbered lists,bullet lists, Definition lists


- **  the types of the lists im HTML**
1.  **Ordered lists**
> are lists where each item in the list is 
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for 
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract 
where each point needs to be identified by a section 
number.
2. **Unordered lists**
> are lists that begin with a bullet point 
(rather than characters that indicate order)
 3.  **Definition lists**
 > are made up of a set of terms along with the 
definitions for each of those terms

1.  *Ordered lists*

The ordered list is created with 
the `<ol>` element

>Each item in the list is placed 
between an opening `<li>` tag 
and a closing `</li>` tag. (The li
stands for list item.)
Browsers indent lists by default.
Sometimes you may see a type
attribute used with the `<ol>`
element to specify the type of 
numbering (numbers, letters, 
roman numerals and so on). It 
is better to use the CSS liststyle-type property covered 
on pages 333-335.

2. *Unordered lists*

The unordered list is created 
with the` <ul>` element.

>Each item in the list is placed 
between an opening `<li>` tag 
and a closing `</li>` tag. (The li
stands for list item.)
Browsers indent lists by default.
Sometimes you may see a type
attribute used with the `<ul>`
element to specify the type of 
bullet point (circles, squares, 
diamonds and so on). It is better 
to use the CSS list-styletype property covered on pages 
333-335

3. *Definition Lists*

The definition list is created with 
the `<dl>` element and usually 
consists of a series of terms and 
their definitions.
Inside the `<dl>` element you will 
usually see pairs of `<dt>` and 
`<dd>` elements.
* `<dt>`

This is used to contain the term 
being defined (the definition 
term).
* `<dd>`
This is used to contain the 
definition
>Sometimes you might see a list 
where there are two terms used 
for the same definition or two 
different definitions for the same 
term.

## **nested listes**
* You can put a second list inside 
an `<li>` element to create a sublist or nested list.
Browsers display nested lists 
indented further than the parent 
list. In nested unordered lists, 
the browser will usually change 
the style of the bullet point too.

and this is an example 

```HTML
<ul>
<li>Mousses</li>
<li>Pastries
 <ul>
 <li>Croissant</li>
 <li>Mille-feuille</li>
 <li>Palmier</li>
 <li>Profiterole</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>Tarts</li>
</ul>
```
## the boxes in `HTML`
* At the beginning of this section on CSS, 
you saw how CSS treats each HTML 
element as if it lives in its own box.
> You can set several properties that affect the appearance of 
these boxes
> Once you have learned how to control the appearance of each 
box, you will see how to position these boxes on your pages later on 

* box Dimensions `width, height`

> By default a box is sized just big 
enough to hold its contents. To 
set your own dimensions for a 
box you can use the height and 
width properties.
The most popular ways to 
specify the size of a box are 
to use pixels, percentages, or 
ems. Traditionally, pixels have 
been the most popular method 
because they allow designers to 
accurately control their size.
When you use percentages, 
the size of the box is relative to 
the size of the browser window 
or, if the box is encased within 
another box, it is a percentage of 
the size of the containing box.
When you use ems, the size 
of the box is based on the size 
of text within it. Designers 
have recently started to use 
percentages and ems more for 
measurements as they try to 
create designs that are flexible 
across devices which have 
different-sized screens.

* In the example below, you 
can see that a containing <div>
element is used which is 300 
pixels wide by 300 pixels high. 
Inside of this is a paragraph 
that is 75% of the width and 
height of the containing element. 
This means that the size of the 
paragraph is 225 pixels wide by 
225 pixels high

```
<div>
<p>The Moog company pioneered the commercial
 manufacture of modular voltage-controlled 
 analog synthesizer systems in the early 
 1950s.</p>
</div>
```
```
div.box {
height: 300px;
width: 300px;
background-color: #bbbbaa;}
p {
height: 75%;
width: 75%;
background-color: #0088dd;}
```

**Overflowing content **

The overflow property tells the 
browser what to do if the content 
contained within a box is larger 
than the box itself. It can have 
one of two values:
hidden
This property simply hides any 
extra content that does not fit in 
the box.
scroll
This property adds a scrollbar to 
the box so that users can scroll 
to see the missing content.
On the left, you can see two 
boxes whose contents expand 
beyond their set dimensions. The 
first example has the overflow
property with a value of hidden. 
The second example has the 
overflow property with a value 
of scroll.
The overflow property is 
particularly handy because some 
browsers allow users to adjust 
the size of the text to appear as 
large or as small as they want. If 
the text is set too large then the 
page can become an unreadable 
mess. Hiding the overflow on 
such boxes helps prevent items 
overlapping on the page

and this is an example 

```
<h2>Fender Stratocaster</h2>
<p class="one">The Fender Stratocaster or "Strat" 
 is one of the most popular electric guitars of 
 all time, and its design has been copied by many 
 guitar makers. It was designed by Leo... </p>
<h2>Gibson Les Paul</h2>
<p class="two">The Gibson Les Paul is a solid body 
 electric guitar that was first sold in 1952. 
 The Les Paul was designed by Ted McCarty... </p>
 ```
 ```
 p.one {
overflow: hidden;}
p.two {
overflow: scroll;}
```

# ARRAYS in  javascript 

* An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't 
just store one value; it stores a list of values.
>You should consider using an 
array whenever you are working 
with a list or a set of values that 
are related to each other. 
Arrays are especially helpful 
when you do not know how 
many items a list will contain 
because, when you create the 
array, you do not need to specify 
how many values it will hold. 
If you don't know how many 
items a list will contain, rather 
than creating enough variables 
for a long list (when you might 
only use a small percentage 
of them), using an array is 
considered a better solution. 
For example, an array can be 
suited to storing the individual 
items on a shopping list because 
it is a list of related items. 
Additionally, each time you write 
a new shopping list, the number 
of items on it may differ. 
As you will see on the next page, 
values in an array are separated 
by commas. 
In Chapter 12, you will see that 
arrays can be very helpful when 
representing complex data.

* **CREATING AN ARRAY**

You create an array and give it 
a name just like you would any 
other variable (using the var 
keyword followed by the name of 
the array). 
The values are assigned to the 
array inside a pair of square 
brackets, and each value is 
separated by a comma. The 
values in the array do not need 
to be the same data type, so you 
can store a string, a number and 
a Boolean all in the same array. 
This technique for creating 
an array is known as an array 
literal. It is usually the preferred 
method for creating an array. 
You can also write each value on 
a separate line: 
`colors= ['white', 
'black', 
'custom']; `
On the left, you can see an 
array created using a different 
technique called an array 
constructor. This uses the new 
keyword followed by Array(); 
The values are then specified 
in parentheses (not square 
brackets), and each value is 
separated by a comma. You can 
also use a method called i tern() 
to retrieve data from the array. 
(The index number of the item is 
specified in the parentheses.) 

* **VALUES IN ARRAYS**

Values in an array are accessed as if they are in 
a numbered list. It is important to know that the 
numbering of this list starts at zero **(not one)**. 
>Each item in an array is 
automatically given a number 
called an index. This can be used 
to access specific items in the 
array. Consider the following 
array which holds three colors: 

`var colors; `
`colors= ['white','black' ,'custom']`  

 

Confusingly, index values start at 
0 (not 1), so the following table 
shows items from the array and 
their corresponding index values:

index | value
------------ | -------------
0|white
1|black
2|custom
