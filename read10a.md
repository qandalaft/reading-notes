# Error handling javascript: -

In general, error handling it's mean means problems that prevented from executing the code, whether they were problems in Syntax, logic, or arithmetic. These problems can be discovered through some sentences in JavaScript.

for example:

The `try` statement lets you test a block of code for errors.

The `catch` statement lets you handle the error.

The `throw` statement lets you create custom errors.

The `finally` statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.

### What's is the Debugging?

Performing the debugging process is not an easy thing and it needs us to be familiar with and have a good understanding of error handling, but fortunately, all modern browsers come with a built-in JavaScript debugger and we can turn it on or off.

> (w3schools) Code Debugging:
>- Programming code might contain syntax errors, or logical errors.
>- Many of these errors are difficult to diagnose.
>**Often, when programming code contains errors, nothing will happen. There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors, searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging.**

Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have a built-in JavaScript debugger.
> - Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user.
> - With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints (places where code execution can be stopped), and examine variables while the code is executing.
> - Normally, otherwise follow the steps at the bottom of this page, you activate debugging in your browser with the F12 key, and select "Console" in the debugger menu.
