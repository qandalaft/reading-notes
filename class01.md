# HTML 
## HTML Describes
the Structure 
of Pages
- In the browser window you can see a web page that features exactly 
the same content as the Word document you met on the page 18. To 
describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want 
to appear on the page
- You can see the HTML code for this page below. 
it contans the main elements in HTML
like `body` its called Semantics and we will talk about it in details later on
and also the `tags<>` also we  will talk about it in details later on   
```
<html>
<body>
 <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
 <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of 
 the page. And if the page is a long one it might 
 be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
 <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help 
 you follow the structure of what is being written. 
 There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level 
 headings).</p>
 <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
- the `tags<>`

** what is the `tags<>`**

Tags act like containers. They tell you 
something about the information that lies 
between their opening and closing tags

1. The opening `<html>` tag indicates that anything between it and a closing `</html>` tag is HTML code.
2. The `<body>` tag indicates that anything between it and the closing 
`</body>` tag should be shown inside the main browser window
3. Words between `<h1>` and `</h1>` are a main heading
As Kanye West said:

> note: the `<h1>` and `</h1>` its called `tags`
>and we will talk about all of its  later on 

4. A  paragraph of text appears between these `<p>` and `</p>` tags.
5. Words between <h2> and </h2> form a sub-heading.
6. he closing `</body>` tag indicates the end of what should appear in the main browser window.
7. he closing `</html>` tag indicates that it is the end of the HTML code.

### the attributes
- Attributes provide additional information 
about the contents of an element. They appear 
on the opening tag of the element and are 
made up of two parts: a name and a value, 
separated by an equals sign
